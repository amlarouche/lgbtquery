LGBTQuery is hosted live at [https://lgbtquery.vercel.app/](https://lgbtquery.vercel.app/). 

LGBTQuery is a small Next.js 13 application built with Chakra UI that searches the Github API for queer or LGBTQ projects and identifies their contributors. As a tool, LGBTQuery's goal is to assist in identifying queer coders and fostering community between them. Additionally, employers can search for queer coders, increasing the percentage of ones currently in the workforce.

Whether you're an employer or a peer, you can ue LGBTQuery to find your next collaborator. Start by searching what kind of project, framework, or technology you're looking for experience in (perhaps `docker`, or `react`?) and the language you'd like to see present in the project. Then, browse through the results to find repositories that sound interesting to you. Once you've clicked on a repository, check out the contributors to the project and go to their Github profiles for their contact information, or just more about them.

## Starting LGBTQuery locally

First, clone the repository: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amlarouche/lgbtquery.git
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash

# or

# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
